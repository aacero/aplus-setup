# aplus-setup
Some notes re: using A+ on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

1. Run aplus_setup and resolve any issues with missing locales
2. Run a+_wrapper.  The wrapper uses rlwrap to provide readline
support to the a+ binary, so full line-editing, history and history
search are available.
3. Refer to aaa.gif for the configured keyboard layout.  Enter special
symbols with 'Alt' or 'Alt-Shift'.
